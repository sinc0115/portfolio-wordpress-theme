# What is it?
Custom WordPress theme, specially created for a portfolio website.

## The Client
This recent Electrical Engineering grad was looking for a place to host projects and a resume, to share with potential employers. 
The goal was to create a site that would be easy for them to update and a breeze to maintain-- let them worry about the projects to fill it with and not the website maintenance. For this reason, WordPress was chosen as the CMS. The simple, intuitive admin dashboard allows the client to easily add new projects, without having to fiddle with any code unnecessarily. 

## The Design
Inspiration was taken directly from the field of Electical Engineering. The moodboard is filled with electrial circuits and the idea of electricity being an illuminating power. After extensive research, I found successful portfolio websites strike a balance between professionalism and showcasing personality. I sought to create a theme that led with a pop of whimsy and color... but was punctuated with the serious nature of the client's work. 
The UX/UI was powered by research that perscribed the "less clicks, the better". The design provides highlights of the client's resume and portfolio. There is enough information presented to entice any recruiter... but not so much that the user is overwhelmed. Prototypes created using Adobe XD. 

## The Graphics
Carefully created to add color and break up the website sections, without distracting from the content. They are dynamic and confident, like the client. Created using Adobe Illustrator. 

## The Website
I completed the domain registration, SSL certificate setup, WordPress installation, and theme download/setup.
